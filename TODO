ControlFile generation:
- format description

izpack
------
- document methods
- 'automagic mode' (generate most stuff from POM)
- automatically add license if LicensePanel is in use

- remove the AOT section automatically if AOT-compilation is disabled
- compile all dependency Jars with AOT
- add more logging messages to IzPackDescriptor methods

deb:
- when localDebianDepot (a directory) is given:
  - copy *.debs into ${depotDir}/binary
  - execute an update script for the depot
  - that is: dpkg-scanpackages binary /dev/null | gzip -9c > binary/Packages.gz
  - (if there is no depot dir it will be created)
- properly calculate the installed size (all files should be summed up)

all

- fix that CVS and SVN files are not copied

misc:
- write documentation
- automatic injection of JAF dependency if axis (or whatever library this
was) is detected
