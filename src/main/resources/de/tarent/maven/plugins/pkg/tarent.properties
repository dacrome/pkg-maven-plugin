# Version 3 - Always regard the latest version of this text.

# This is a property file describing a Maven artifactId <-> Debian package name <-> Jar file name 
# <-> filesystem location mapping.

# The key is a maven artifactId and the value area are CSV where each entry
# means the following
# maven-artifactId=package name, jar file names, path

# The jar file names should be a whitespace separated line of entries, like
# " foo.jar  baz.jar foobar.jar  ".

# The values can be omitted from right to left. Omissions have certain
# effects.

# Omission		Effect (inclusive from bottom to top)
# path			Revert to default path in Debian which is /usr/share/java
# jar names		Use artifactId + ".jar"
# package name  Use artifact instead (blank line)

# The special value of [IGNORE] marks that a certain Maven artifact
# has no mapping in Debian and is not needed there.

# Mappings for tarent projects:
octopus-client-api=[BUNDLE]
spreadsheet-export=[BUNDLE]
tarent-commons=[BUNDLE]
tcVersion=[BUNDLE]
